# WAMOJI

## What's that?

This is a small script that can parse through a WhatsApp conversation and extract statistics about your smiley usage.

## How?

Gather your conversation from the WhatsApp application (they send it to you via email) and download it.

Launch the script with the conversation file as first argument:

```
python wamoji.py conversation.txt
```

It will generate an HTML file with some statistics.
